## Project: Animals Classification before and after applying traditional Feature Extractors (HOG, SIFT, ORB) using traditional Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This repository showcases the implementation of Multiclass Classification, Animals Image Dataset problem using traditional Feature extractors like HOG, SIFT, ORB with tradtional Machine Learning Models like SVM, KNN, MLP

## Some of the Implementation Points

- Applying Machine Learning models on raw iamge dataset without applying any feature extraction algorithm

- Applying ML models on features extracted from HOG Feature Extractor

- Applying ML models on features extracted from ORB Feature Extractor

- Applying ML models on features extracted from SIFT Feature Extractor
